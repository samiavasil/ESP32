=== MQTT Tools ===

1. MQTT clients
	* [[http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/|HIVEMQ Websockets Client Showcase]]
	* [[https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt-spy|MQTT-Spy]]
	* [[http://workswithweb.com/mqttbox.html|MQTTBox]]
	
2. ESP32


=== MQTT Test Servers: ===

http://mqtt.eclipse.org/       http://www.mqtt-dashboard.com/
Tested with: [[https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt-spy|MQTT-Spy,]] [[ESP32 MQTT IOT network|ESP32 Mqtt client]]
Server CA works with Certificate: [[./mqtt_eclipse_org.pem|mqtt_eclipse_org.pem]] 
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
tcp -> mqtt://mqtt.eclipse.org
ssl -> mqtts://mqtt.eclipse.org:8883
ws  -> ws://mqtt.eclipse.org:80/mqtt
wss -> wss://mqtt.eclipse.org:443/mqtt
}}}

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
Tested with:
tcp: 1883
ws: 8000
MQTT-Spy, tcp, ws 
MQTTBox   tcp
}}}



test.mosquitto.org:1883        https://test.mosquitto.org/  
Tested with: [[https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt-spy|MQTT-Spy]] tcp, ssl , ws, wss
Server CA works with Certificate: [[./mosquitto.org.crt]] 
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
The server listens on the following ports:

	1883 : MQTT, unencrypted
	8883 : MQTT, encrypted
	8884 : MQTT, encrypted, client certificate required
	8080 : MQTT over WebSockets, unencrypted
	8081 : MQTT over WebSockets, encrypted
}}}

Good but has an issue with bad RSA (short) keys in CA certificate. 
Task: Check Alternatives as described here https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/2993
