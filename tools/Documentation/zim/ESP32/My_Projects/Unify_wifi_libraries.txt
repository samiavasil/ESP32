====== Unify wifi libraries ======
Created неделя 24 ноември 2019

===== Information =====
The idea is to create a wrapper library for WiFI connectivity, with a common configuration for all connection types (WEP, WPA, WPA enterprice, etc.).
It should be possible to configure it at build time (via menuconfig), but it must be able to switch between different connection types at runtime.
The library should maintain wifi smart configuration whenever possible.
